# python-API-Weather-and-Vacation

This file includes a Python script to visualize the weather of 500+ cities across the world of varying distance from the equator

The data is from OpenWeatherMap API 

The research shows series of scatter plots to showcase the following relationships for all the cities, the cities only in the northern hemisphere and cities only in the southern hemisphere:

Temperature (C) vs. Latitude
Humidity (%) vs. Latitude
Cloudiness (%) vs. Latitude
Wind Speed (kph) vs. Latitude

Correlation and linear regression models shows the relationships between the two parameters tested.

Data was obtained from Google Places API to find hotels within 5km radius of a given location with given optimum weather parameters.
